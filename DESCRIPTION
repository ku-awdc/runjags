Description: User-friendly interface utilities for MCMC models via
    Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS), facilitating the use of parallel
    (or distributed) processors for multiple chains, automated control
    of convergence and sample length diagnostics, and evaluation of the
    performance of a model using drop-k validation or against simulated
    data. Template model specifications can be generated using a standard
    lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the
    BUGS syntax.  A JAGS extension module provides additional distributions
    including the Pareto family of distributions, the DuMouchel prior and
    the half-Cauchy prior.
